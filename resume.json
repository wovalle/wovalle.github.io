When I'm not coding for work, I'm scratching my head trying to make new shining leds to turn on with my Arduino based circuits or making jokes about why my Raspberry Pi doesn't want to turn on again.

Fireorm is a tiny wrapper on top of firebase-admin that makes life easier when dealing with a Firestore database. Fireorm tries to ease the development of apps that rely on Firestore at the database layer by abstracting the access layer providing and familiar repository pattern. It basically helps us not worrying about Firestore details and focusing in what matters: adding cool new features!"
